    "1. Different Data Structures in TensorFlow:\n",
    "TensorFlow primarily uses two main data structures: tensors and graphs.\n",
    "Tensors: Tensors are the fundamental data structure in TensorFlow. They are multi-dimensional arrays that represent the data flowing between operations in a computational graph. Tensors can be of different ranks (0D, 1D, 2D, etc.) and data types (float32, int32, etc.). Examples:\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "scalar_tensor = tf.constant(3.14)  # 0D tensor (scalar)\n",
    "vector_tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])  # 1D tensor (vector)\n",
    "matrix_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # 2D tensor (matrix)\n",
    "Graphs: TensorFlow uses a computational graph to represent the sequence of operations in a model. Nodes in the graph represent operations, and edges represent the flow of tensors between operations. Graphs provide a way to optimize and distribute computations across devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.TensorFlow Constant: Constants are tensors whose values cannot be changed once defined. They are created using tf.constant and are useful for representing fixed values.\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "constant_tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "TensorFlow Variable: Variables are tensors whose values can be changed during the execution of a graph. They are typically used to represent trainable parameters in a model.\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "initial_values = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "variable_tensor = tf.Variable(initial_values)\n",
    "The key difference is that the value of a constant is fixed, while the value of a variable can be modified using operations like assign.\n",
